# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Rekapu and blocking your first distracting website.

## Step 1: Open the Extension

Click the Rekapu icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup interface.

## Step 2: Add Your First Blocked Domain

1. Navigate to the **Domains** tab
2. Enter a domain you want to block (e.g., `twitter.com`)
3. Set a cooldown period (e.g., 30 minutes)
4. Click **Add Domain**

The extension will now block this domain and require you to answer a question before accessing it.

## Step 3: Create Your First Question

1. Navigate to the **Questions** tab
2. Click **New Question**
3. Choose a question type (start with **Single Choice**)
4. Enter your question text in the **Front** field
5. Enter the correct answer in the **Back** field
6. For single choice, add 3-4 answer options
7. Add tags to organize your questions (optional)
8. Click **Save**

### Example Question

**Front:** What is the capital of France?  
**Options:**
- London
- Paris ✓
- Berlin
- Madrid

**Back:** Paris is the capital of France.

## Step 4: Test the Blocking

1. Try to navigate to the domain you blocked (e.g., `twitter.com`)
2. You'll see a blocking overlay with a question
3. Answer the question
4. Review the correct answer
5. Rate the difficulty (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)
6. The site will unlock for the cooldown period

## Step 5: Configure Settings

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
2. Set a global cooldown period (applies to all domains by default)
3. Adjust other preferences as needed

## Tips for Success

- Start with a few well-crafted questions rather than many low-quality ones
- Use the markdown support to format your questions clearly
- Begin with sites you check frequently but don't need for work
- Set realistic cooldown periods that match your workflow

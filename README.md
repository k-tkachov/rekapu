## What is Rekapu?

Rekapu is a browser extension that combines spaced repetition learning with website access control. Instead of blocking you with a wall, it shows you flashcards when you visit distracting websites. Your knowledge grows while your focus improves - no extra apps, no dedicated study time, just learning integrated into your day.

**The key difference:** Unlike traditional website blockers that redirect you to a new page (losing your scroll position and context), Rekapu uses an **overlay approach**. After answering a card, you continue exactly where you left off - no reload, no lost context.

## Features

### 🧠 Spaced Repetition
Science-backed algorithm that shows cards at optimal intervals. Rate difficulty (Again, Hard, Good, Easy) and let the algorithm handle scheduling for maximum retention.

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech
Listen to your cards with natural voice synthesis powered by Google TTS. Perfect for audio learners and language practice. *Requires your own API key.*

### 📊 Daily Goals & Streaks  
Activity calendar visualizes your consistency. Build learning streaks, hit daily goals, and watch your progress compound over time.

### 📦 Anki Import
Already have decks in Anki? Import plain text (.txt) files instantly. No need to recreate your cards - bring your existing knowledge base.

### ✍️ Markdown Support
Format cards with markdown syntax. Add code blocks, lists, bold text, links, and embed images. Live preview while editing ensures cards look exactly as intended.

### 🎴 Multiple Card Types
- **Basic (Show Answer)**: Traditional flashcard with front/back
- **Cloze Deletion**: Fill-in-the-blank with `{{c1::text}}` syntax, supporting multiple deletions per card

### 🔒 100% Private
All data stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. No servers, no tracking, no accounts. Your cards and browsing habits stay completely private.

### 🌍 Multi-language Support
Currently available in **English**, **Russian**, and **Ukrainian**. [More translations welcome!](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Architecture Highlights

#### Overlay Blocking System
Rekapu uses an innovative iframe overlay approach that preserves page state, scroll position, and JavaScript context. This provides a seamless experience compared to traditional redirect-based blocking.

#### Universal Markdown Rendering
- Same renderer (marked.js) used in card editor and blocking interface
- Isolated CSS prevents theme conflicts
- Live preview with scroll synchronization
- Consistent rendering across all contexts

#### Efficient Storage
- IndexedDB for high-performance local storage
- Indexed queries for spaced repetition optimization
- Storage usage monitoring and intelligent cleanup
- Supports 100MB+ capacity
